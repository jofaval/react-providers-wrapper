<div align="center">
<h1>react-providers-wrapper</h1>

Nest your React providers
</div>

## Why?

For code style purposes, when you have a bigger React App, you may end up with a lot of nested providers at your App which may be confusing to look at.

This package proposes a solution that nicely wraps all of those Providers so that it's easier to track the hierarchy.
